Is setting a margin the only way?",

Honestly, this is probably going to be a simple obvious answer I just can't catch. But here's the problem: I am making a website out of HTML5, CSS, and some PHP.\n\nThe issue is, that my links appear blue and purple with an underline. I know this is how they are supposed to look, but I have tried many different ways to re-style the links with text-decoration: none, and different colors and so on.",
